    No instance for (Show (R s0 (Foreign.R.SomeSEXP * s0)))
      arising from a use of `print'
    Possible fix:
      add an instance declaration for
      (Show (R s0 (Foreign.R.SomeSEXP * s0)))
    In a stmt of an interactive GHCi command: print it
Error in xy.coords(x, y, xlabel, ylabel, log) :
